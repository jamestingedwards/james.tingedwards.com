My team at InternetNZ built a proof-of-concept tweet-bot, to automatically put items from the NZ Gazette on Twitter. You can find it at [@PublicNoticesNZ](https://twitter.com/PublicNoticesNZ), more detail [on InternetNZ's blog](https://internetnz.nz/blog/tweeting-public-notices-act), and the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/InternetNZ/PublicNoticesNZ) if you'd like to improve it!

I helped with get the first version running, but what's online now is much more polished thanks to good work from Nicola and Dean. I'm both delighted and terrified to have code I wrote running on the Internet.
