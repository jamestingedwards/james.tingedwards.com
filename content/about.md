At work, I do policy thinking and projects for [InternetNZ](https://internetnz.nz). I have also worked in private practice, advising New Zealand businesses on intellectual property issues, and at a university, teaching legal ethics and critical thinking.

Outside work, I do improvised theater with the [Covert Theatre](https://covert) and help people in legal, policy, and technology worlds listen to each other. It's a challenge making my personal life as nerdy as my work, but I'm trying my best.
